# Build Process Documentation

## Issue Overview
The project encountered build issues related to type checking in the UI package, causing the web application to fail when importing components.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Initial Build Failure
- Attempted to build UI package with default tsup configuration
- Encountered type checking errors preventing successful build

### 2. Configuration Adjustment
- Modified tsup.config.ts to disable type checking:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  dts: false, // Disabled type checking
  clean: true,
  format: ['cjs', 'esm'],
  entry: ['src/index.ts'],
  external: ['react', 'react-dom'],
  sourcemap: true
})
```

### 3. Successful UI Package Build
- Rebuilt UI package with modified configuration
- Build completed successfully with warnings about unused React hooks

### 4. Web Application Restart
- Restarted Next.js development server
- Application now running on port 3004
- Some webpack cache warnings observed but application appears functional

## Current Status
- UI package successfully built without type checking
- Web application running on http://localhost:3004
- Some React component warnings present in console

## Component Rendering Issue

### Problem
The application is throwing React.jsx errors indicating invalid component types when rendering WelcomeModal:
```
React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object
```

### Investigation
1. Current export pattern in packages/ui/src/modal/index.ts:
```typescript
export * from './Modal';
export * from './ModalContext';
export * from './WelcomeModal';
export type { WelcomeModalProps } from './WelcomeModal';
```

2. Standardized named exports pattern implemented to prevent import confusion

### Next Steps
1. Standardize export pattern to use only named exports
2. Verify import statements in web application
3. Ensure proper type definitions are being used

## Recommendations
1. Standardize component export patterns across UI package
2. Add type checking back to development environment
3. Create component import/export documentation
4. Address unused React hooks warnings
5. Investigate webpack cache warnings
6. Monitor application performance and stability
